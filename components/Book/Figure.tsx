 * horizontal room to outset into. Sub-`lg:` everything collapses to
 * body width (= prose column width).
 *
 * The escape uses the standard "negative-margin to viewport-edge"
 * trick:
 *
 *   margin-left  = 50% - 50vw + Xrem
 *   max-width    = 100vw - 2*Xrem
 *
 * Where X is the inset distance from the viewport edge. The `mx-`
 * arbitrary-value class sets *both* horizontal margins to that
 * negative value, which (combined with `max-w-[100vw-2*Xrem]`)
 * produces a centered figure with `Xrem` of breathing room from each
 * viewport edge.
 *
 * Inset choices:
 *   body-outset   — 8rem inset (light escape; ~880px on a 1280 screen)
 *   page-outset   — 4rem inset (substantial escape; ~1152px on 1280)
 *   screen-inset  — 2rem inset (near-bleed; ~1216px on 1280)
 *
 * Note: at `lg:` (1024px), even `body-outset` collapses to roughly
 * body width because the calc resolves to ~0 margin. The visual
 * difference between zones really shows at `xl:` (1280px) and up,
 * which matches how Distill handled it — escape is a desktop-only
 * affordance.

/**
 * Figure — Distill-style layout zone wrapper. Use to give a chart,
 * SmallMultiples, table, or image more (or less) horizontal room than
 * the prose column. Authors pick the zone editorially:
 *
 * | width        | Use for                                              |
 * | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
 * | body         | inline figure, single chart (default)                |
 * | body-outset  | hero chart that wants slight breathing room          |
 * | page-outset  | SmallMultiples 4-up, wide table, comparison figure   |
 * | screen-inset | rare — full-bleed-ish punctuation                    |
 *
 * Below md:, every zone collapses to body width.
 *
 * Implementation note: this component emits a `<figure>` element. If
 * an inner component (DataTable, SmallMultiples) also emits a
 * `<figure>`, you'd get nested figures. To avoid that, those
 * components should be passed without their own figure wrapper, OR you
 * wrap a chart's `<div>` directly without emitting a second figure.
 *
 * Use:
 *
 *   <Figure width="page-outset" caption="Figure 4. Confidence in four institutions, by education.">
 *     <SmallMultiples ...>...</SmallMultiples>
 *   </Figure>
 *
 * If your inner content is itself a complete figure (like DataTable or
 * the existing SmallMultiples, which both render their own
 * <figcaption>), omit `caption` and just use Figure for the width
 * escape:
 *
 *   <Figure width="page-outset">
 *     <SmallMultiples ...>...</SmallMultiples>
 *   </Figure>
